This viewer includes many patches and changes from a lot of different people and sources which I am very grateful
to be able to use. Credits are given to everyone I know, in case I missed someone I sincerely apologize.

Thanks to Henri Beauchamp who laid the foundation for this viewer with his Cool SL Viewer. Special thanks to
Winter Ventura for the Cool Viewer logo and Jacek Antonelli and Peter Stindberg for the Rainbow Viewer logo :).
And to all the others who helped and supported me, especially the people involved and behind Imprudence!

Patches by Boy Lane:

* DisallowLindenHairRemoval: fix for RLV that prevents removal of hair/hairbase that leads to unrezzed AVs
* GPU_Table: adds a new GPU table of supported graphic cards from Snowglobe 
* Incomplete OblongSculpties: backport from 1.23 that fixes incomplete rendering of some sculpties 
* JigglyBewbz: Breast physics aka jiggly bewbz from Emerald. Complicated confguration left in debug settings.

Patches by Gigs Taggart: 
* Duckwalk: cosmetic patch for the "duck walk" of AO-less avatars (VWR-1603).
* LostConnectionOnLogin: fixes spurious "crashes" (disconnections) on login (VWR-8783). 

Patches by Henri Beauchamp: 
* AllowDiscardForCreator: enables the "Discard" button in the notecards that you created and that are given to you with llGiveInventory(). Fixes the VWR-2290 bug. 
* CommonDateAndTimeFormats: allows to configure the time and date formats and to use them coherently everywhere in the viewer (fixes VWR-721 among others).
* DefaultSaveLoadDirectory: use the HOME directory by default for saving pictures or uploading pictures, animations and sounds, instead of the viewer installation directory.
* DefaultToFmod: under Linux, makes sure the Fmod sound wrapper is used by default (this can be changed back by editing the "secondlife" wrapper script), since the new OpenAL support is still very flaky on most hardware/distro.
* DrawDistanceInCameraControls: Adds a draw distance spinner in the camera controls floater, for easy adjustements.
* FetchInventoryOnLogin: allows to fetch and cache the inventory in the background upon login (prevents "loading..." delays later on, when opening rarely used folders in your inventory).
* gcc43-Warnings: allow to compile the v1.22 and v1.23 viewers with gcc v4.3.
* GtkFilePickerFilterLoadXML: fixes a bug with the GTK file picker when trying to load a XML file (the *.xml filter was not set).
* HideIMinChatConsole: allows to optionally prevent IMs to show in the main chat. Implements the VWR-3060 feature.
* HideNotificationsInChat: allows to optionally prevent the notifications (those small messages appearing in a blue box on the lower right corner of the viewer window) to show and be logged in the main chat.
* ImageGLPickMaskCrashFix patch: fixes a bug that sometimes crashes the viewer when touching (or caming on) an object which is being rezzed.
* InventoryDoubleClickActions: defines double-click actions in inventory for objects (wear as attachments or remove if already worn), and clothes/body parts (wear when not worn, or remove when worn). Implements the VWR-1752 and part of the VWR-1825 features. 
* InventoryDoubleClickActions_RestrainedLife_addon.patch.bz2: addon patch for usage restrictions with RestrainedLife active. 
* KeepCachedSounds: cures the sound problems in -multiple mode, and allows to keep cached sounds over sessions. Fixes the VWR-2876 bug. 
* LandmarksDiscardButton: restores the "Discard" button in the new landmarks floater. Fixes the VWR-3616 regression. 
* LargePrims: allows to build large prims (up to 256m large) in OpenSim.
* MaxNetworkBandwidth: unleashes the maximum network bandwidth, preventing the repetitive throttling by the viewer (which slows down rezzing compared to what it can be on high speed connections). Note: setting the max bandwidth to 4Mbps or so should be more than enough as I never saw more than 2.5 Mbps used by the viewer (the bandwidth is also limited server side anyway as it depends on the number of residents in the sim and on the network link speed for this sim). 
* MoonBrightness: corrects the brightness of the moon, allowing to actually see it, especially when it's close to the horizon.
* MouseLookFocusSwitchQuirk: Fixes quirks with the SL viewer window focus switching not properly restoring mouse-look and resetting the camera zoom level (fixes VWR-14666 among others). 
* MUposeStyleAndOOCautoClose: allows to use the MUCK/MUSH/MUX/MUD pose style (VWR-3093) and allows to auto-close double-parenthesis (Out Of Character) chat/IM poses.
* NewNotecardSaveButton: adds a "Save" button to new/received notecards. 
* NoMultipleLocaleWarnings: prevents messages such as "WARNING: LLLocale: Failed to set locale en_US.utf8" to appear hundreds of times in the log file (any locale loading failure now appears once only in the log). 
* OldTrackingDotsInMinimap: reinstates the "old" (pre-v1.18.4) mini-map icons for "above" and "below" avatars. Fixes the VWR-2808 regression. Set the "UseOldTrackingDots" flag to TRUE, and restart the viewer to enable this feature. 
* PrivateLookAt: Adds a PrivateLookAt setting to prevent your avatar to focus its eyes and point its arm to objects or avatars beyond 20m of distance (since this is usually unwanted or simply random (hovering mouse cursor in the background). This also to defeats the spying tools developed in some viewers (they can display where everyone is looking at).
* Radar_RestrainedLife_addon: addon patch for usage restrictions of Radar with RestrainedLife active.
* ReinstateOldSearchTabs (not needed for v1.19 and older): reinstates the "All (Old)" search tab as well as the old style (non-web) Groups search tab.
* ReinstateShowTextureUUID: reverts the "fix" for VWR-1919: security by opacity is a delusion: removing this feature would not prevent pirates to steal your textures, while it would prevent you to verify that some object has been textured with your own textures. And by the way, there are much better (much more efficient) ways for a pirate to steal the textures (by using the cached files, for example)... 
* RememberMinimizedFloatersPosition: Fixes the VWR-5530 regression (minimized floaters not remembering their position). 
* SaveScriptsAsMono: Allows to save scripts in inventory as Mono scripts instead of LSL2 (when the SaveScriptsAsMono setting is set to TRUE). Fixes VWR-8827.
* SaveTextureAsFileExtension: fixes a problem with textures being saved without the proper .tga filename extension.
* SearchDescAndCreator: based on Emerald, this patch allows to search the inventory for matching words in item names (default and normal behaviour) and/or item description and/or item creator.
* SpeedRez_v2: "speeds up" rezzing (actually rez closer objects first) on login and teleports, by temporarily reducing the draw distance to 32m and stepping it back up to its original value at a regular interval of time after login/TP. This feature is enabled when the SpeedRez variable is set to TRUE, and the interval may be adjusted via the SpeedRezInterval variable (defaults to 12s).  
* TeleportHistory_RestrainedLife_addon: addon patch for usage restrictions of TeleportHistory with RestrainedLife active.
* UnknownJointsCrashFix: fixes some crashes that can occur when encountering avatars wearing objects on unofficial attachment points.

Miscellaneous patches:
* DoubleClickTeleport (unknown author: from Emerald viewer): implements a double-click teleport feature (double-clicking in world, teleports you at the mouse pointer position, provided the parcel teleport routing allows it). This also makes the "Go To" pie menu use teleport instead of auto-pilot.
* FlexibleSculpties (by Zwagoth Klaar & Qarl Linden): implements flexible sculpties (BEWARE: flexible sculpties introduce a *lot* of lag on the viewer side: use sparsely!). Implements VWR-9203.
* ForceSitOnGround: based on Emerald, reimplemented by Henri Beauchamp, this patch allows to sit down anywhere "on the ground" (and not just on actual land ground). Adds a new "Sit On Ground" entry in the "World" menu, bound to a new CTRL ALT SHIFT S shortcut.
* HighFPSwithSlowLinkLag (by Zwagoth Klaar): helps preventing lag spikes on high performance computers with poor Internet uplink bandwidth. Fixes VWR-1488.

* LLFaceVerifyCrash: backport from v1.23 of a fix for a possible crash bug when teleporting.  
* LlhttpclientMemLeak: based on a patch by Carjay McGinnis, this patch plugs a couple of memory leaks (VWR-9400).
