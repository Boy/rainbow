 * @brief This class is an abstract base class for data processing units
 * @see LLPumpIO
 *
 * The LLIOPipe is a base class for implementing the basic non-blocking
 * processing of data subsystem in our system.
 *
 * Implementations of this class should behave like a stateful or
 * stateless signal processor. Each call to <code>process()</code>
 * hands the pipe implementation a buffer and a set of channels in the
 * buffer to process, and the pipe returns the status of the
 * operation. This is an abstract base class and developer created
 * concrete implementations provide block or stream based processing
 * of data to implement a particular protocol.
