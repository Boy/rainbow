/* This function is intended to be used for in-place swizzling, particularly after fread() of
	binary values from a file.  Such as:
	
	numRead = fread(scale.mV, sizeof(float), 3, fp);
	llendianswizzle(scale.mV, sizeof(float), 3);
	
	It assumes that the values in the file are LITTLE endian, so it's a no-op on a little endian machine.
	
	It keys off of typesize to do the correct swizzle, so make sure that typesize is the size of the native type.
	
	64-bit types are not yet handled.
