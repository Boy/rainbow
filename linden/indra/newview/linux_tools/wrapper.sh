## Here are some configuration options for Linux Client Testers.
## These options are for self-assisted troubleshooting during this beta
## testing phase; you should not usually need to touch them.

## - Avoids using any OpenAL audio driver.
export LL_BAD_OPENAL_DRIVER=x
## - Avoids using any FMOD audio driver.
#export LL_BAD_FMOD_DRIVER=x

## - Avoids using the FMOD ESD audio driver.
#export LL_BAD_FMOD_ESD=x
## - Avoids using the FMOD OSS audio driver.
#export LL_BAD_FMOD_OSS=x
## - Avoids using the FMOD ALSA audio driver.
#export LL_BAD_FMOD_ALSA=x

## - Avoids the optional OpenGL extensions which have proven most problematic
##   on some hardware.  Disabling this option may cause BETTER PERFORMANCE but
##   may also cause CRASHES and hangs on some unstable combinations of drivers
##   and hardware.
## NOTE: This is now disabled by default.
#export LL_GL_BASICEXT=x

## - Avoids *all* optional OpenGL extensions.  This is the safest and least-
##   exciting option.  Enable this if you experience stability issues, and
##   report whether it helps in the Linux Client Testers forum.
#export LL_GL_NOEXT=x

## - For advanced troubleshooters, this lets you disable specific GL
##   extensions, each of which is represented by a letter a-o.  If you can
##   narrow down a stability problem on your system to just one or two
##   extensions then please post details of your hardware (and drivers) to
##   the Linux Client Testers forum along with the minimal
##   LL_GL_BLACKLIST which solves your problems.
#export LL_GL_BLACKLIST=abcdefghijklmno

## - Some ATI/Radeon users report random X server crashes when the mouse
##   cursor changes shape.  If you suspect that you are a victim of this
##   driver bug, try enabling this option and report whether it helps:
#export LL_ATI_MOUSE_CURSOR_BUG=x


## Everything below this line is just for advanced troubleshooters.
##-------------------------------------------------------------------

## - For advanced debugging cases, you can run the viewer under the
##   control of another program, such as strace, gdb, or valgrind.  If
##   you're building your own viewer, bear in mind that the executable
##   in the bin directory will be stripped: you should replace it with
##   an unstripped binary before you run.
#export LL_WRAPPER='gdb --args'
#export LL_WRAPPER='valgrind --smc-check=all --error-limit=no --log-file=secondlife.vg --leak-check=full --suppressions=/usr/lib/valgrind/glibc-2.5.supp --suppressions=secondlife-i686.supp'

## - Avoids an often-buggy X feature that doesn't really benefit us anyway.
export SDL_VIDEO_X11_DGAMOUSE=0

## - Works around a problem with misconfigured 64-bit systems not finding GL
export LIBGL_DRIVERS_PATH="${LIBGL_DRIVERS_PATH}":/usr/lib64/dri:/usr/lib32/dri:/usr/lib/dri

## - The 'scim' GTK IM module widely crashes the viewer.  Avoid it.
if [ "$GTK_IM_MODULE" = "scim" ]; then
    export GTK_IM_MODULE=xim
fi

## - Automatically work around the ATI mouse cursor crash bug:
## (this workaround is disabled as most fglrx users do not see the bug)
#if lsmod | grep fglrx &>/dev/null ; then
#	export LL_ATI_MOUSE_CURSOR_BUG=x
#fi


## Nothing worth editing below this line.

You are running the Second Life Viewer on a x86_64 platform.  The
most common problems when launching the Viewer (particularly
'bin/do-not-directly-run-secondlife-bin: not found' and 'error while
loading shared libraries') may be solved by installing your Linux
distribution's 32-bit compatibility packages.
For example, on Ubuntu and other Debian-based Linuxes you might run:
$ sudo apt-get install ia32-libs ia32-libs-gtk ia32-libs-kde ia32-libs-sdl
