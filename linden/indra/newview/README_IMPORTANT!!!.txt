INSTALLATION
============

This installer puts your new Rainbow Viewer::Cool Edition into
C:\Program Files\CoolViewer and it should not mess up any existing SecondLife,
Rainbow Viewer, Cool Viewer or other third party viewer installations. The
following Application Data location is used for settings, logs and caching
(in case of problems you may want to delete this folder manually to reset your
viewer to the  default settings): 

WinXP: C:\Documents and Settings\<you>\Application Data\RainbowViewer\
Vista: C:\Users\<you>\Appdata\Roaming\RainbowViewer\

Please start the Rainbow Viewer::Cool Edition always with the included
Cool Viewer.lnk shortcut only!

IMPORTANT!!!
============ 
Please note that the following libraries and components are not included in the
package as they are not redistributable. The installer will try to automatically
pull them out of an existing installation of a SecondLife, Rainbow Viewer or
Cool Viewer on your machine. Please follow the prompt on the screen. Should it
not work please copy them from an official Linden Labs SL 1.22.11 viewer into
your C:\Program Files\RainbowViewer directory to get full functionality :

llkdu.dll		Kakadu JPEG2000 library
SLVoice.exe		Voice components
vivoxsdk.dll 

The viewer will still run without them but with lower performance (OpenJPEG) and
missing voice features.
